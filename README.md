#  OpenCV for Android

This application allows you to deploy deep nets in Android environment using OpenCV Android SDK. With OpenCV, images are taken from the camera on your phone, and then these images are passed through the neural network and visualized on the front side. In this application, we will search for faces in the images taken and draw the found faces on the screen.


### Requirements

* [Android Studio, SDK, NDK, etc.](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [OpenCV Android SDK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-android/3.4.3/opencv-3.4.3-android-sdk.zip/download)


### Running the application on Android

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/AhmetFurkanDEMIR/OpenCV-for-Android/releases) section and download the FaceDetection_APK.zip here, then install both APK files on your android device. After these procedures, you can run the "Face Detection" application from your mobile device. If the camera does not open, it means that your device has automatically denied camera permission, to solve this problem, go to the settings of the application and give the camera permission.
